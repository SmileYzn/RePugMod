<h3>Why CS 1.6 it's sucks</h3>
<p>
In first place, You're welcome!<br>  
Actually we have CS:GO a more modern version of the game.<br>  
But we can still have fun with a game like Counter-Strike that have been played more than 20 years.<br>  
I think i can help community to have more clean servers that want to play a competitive match.
